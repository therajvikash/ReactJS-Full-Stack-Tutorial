			    		Folder structure of React Application
		      		  ==============================================
1) node_modules 
  - node_modules contines libreres third party library. which we will used to excute    React Application
2) Public 
   - it comprises of Static File like images txt file ...
   - These files are chche files
3) Src 
   - it is comparises of dynamic file. like js , css...
   - by default React js comes with app.js component
  App.js ] both file are by default comes with reactJS
  App.css ] this css file only for app component
  App.test.js --> It is used for testing purpose
  
4) setupTest.js :- it is also used to test the whole application
5) reportsWebVitals.js :- It is used to configure prograssive web app.

6) src/index.js
    - this file called as configration file 
    - This file is used to configure components
7) index.css 
        - it is used for global styles.

8) package.json 
      - in this we find dependencies of 3rd party library wihich we install to use it 



         <div id="root">


	 </div>


<script>
let p = document.getElementById('root');
   p = "Welcome To React JS"

				Components 
		 	==========================
- React is a components based development process
What is components?
- Component is nothing but small part of wepage or ui is called components like (navbar, card home footer .....)

Types of Components 
1) Functional level components (Stateless components)
		Ex:- Functional Components
	import React, {Fragment} from 'react';

	let Navbar  = () => {
    		return (
        	<Fragment>
            	<h2>Welcome to React JS Functional 			Components</h2>
        	</Fragment>
    		)
	}
export default Navbar; 

install this for shorcut components creation >> ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets



		step to start given source code in your pc or lapi

1) download source code from github and extract it.
2) open with VScode.
3) open terminal [ctrl + `]
4) npm install 
5) npm start


2) Class level components (Statefull components)
Ex: Class Level components
import React from 'react';
class ClassCard extends React.Component {
   render() {
       return(
           <React.Fragment>
                <h2> Welcome to Class Level components</h2>
           </React.Fragment>
       )
   }
}
export default ClassCard;



		             React With Bootstrap
             =====================================================
- Install Bootstrap Run below Given Commond.
   
 >>npm install bootstrap
 >> npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
 >> npm install bootstrap @fortawesome/fontawesome-free

- Add bootstrap and fontawesome in your index.js file.
  like this
    import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css'
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';


Note:- In HTML page We are going to using class but in ReactJS We are going To use className instead of class other all thing is same but in css only differance is class and className
-When ever we are using any inline CSS Like this we can use 
		<h3 Style={{backgroundColor:"red"}}></h3>
but in normal CSS
		style= "background-color:"red";"


                         React With Props
                  =============================
What is Props?
- props is a predefined object in Reactjs
- Props is nothing but share data one components to another/3rd party components.
- Tranfer data from parent components to child componenents.

- in react we can access any dynamic by using --> {}
   

				React With State
			===============================
- "state" is used to store components data.
- "state" is predefiend properties of ReactJS.
- Where defined "state" :- state is defined inside the constructor.
- constructor is required to initialize state.
- constructor requires props as arguments to pass into super class construtor.
- when ever we change an state it will automatically re-render the data.
- when ever we fetch data from state we need two thing in class based 
		{this.state.employees(objectName).NameOfData}
				
		How To Create state in Class based components
	===========================================================
Ex:-
import React, { Component} from 'react'

export default class StateEx extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            
        }
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <React.Fragment>
                
            </React.Fragment>
        )
    }
}
